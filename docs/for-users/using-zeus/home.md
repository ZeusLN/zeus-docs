# Home
Zeus home screen is very simple and intuitive, so the user can have a quick access to main functionalities and have a great user experience.

## Home screen sections
- On the left top corner we have the access to settings and profiles.
- On the right top corner is the quick access to camera, to scan QR codes.
- In the middle we have the access to Lightning wallet and On-chain wallet. If you slide them to the right you get access to **Send** and **Recevive** actions, for each wallet.
- At the bottom, we have the access to the transactions log (the arrow ^), access to LN channels management (üßÆ) and the home (üèõ) button.

Here are two examples of home screens, one connected to a home Tor node and another one to a lndhub account.
