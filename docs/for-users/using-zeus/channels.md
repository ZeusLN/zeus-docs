## Main screen channels
1. On top scree, we have a review of total node liquidity, separated by outbound (mas you can send) and inbound (max you can receive), plus the offline balance, from channels that are not connected.
2. Under the balance you have the list of all channels you have with their status and individual balance (inbound and outbound)
3. At the bottom you have the button to go to **Home Main Screen**

## Operations
- If you click on a channel, you will open a new menu to manage that specific channel. You can set specific routing fees and initiate the closure of the channel.
- You can also check the fees your node is charging for forwarding payments through your channels (routing).
